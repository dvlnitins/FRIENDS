# FRIENDS
> Complete Open Source Real-Time Android Chat Application using Firebase.

FRIENDS is a project that I started to improve my Android Development knowledge.
Later on I have decided to make it public and open source.

It uses Firebase's Authentication/Database/Storage/Messaging/CrashReporting libraries for it's implementation
and several other libraries.
